Flag Descriptions:
412fe –h When a –h flag is detected, 412fe will produce a list of valid command-line
arguments that includes a description of all command-line arguments required for Lab 1 as well
as any additional command-line arguments supported by your 412fe implementation.

412fe -s <name> When a -s flag is present, 412fe should read the file specified by <name>
and print, to the standard output stream, a list of the tokens that the scanner found.
For each token, it should print the line number, the token’s type (or syntactic category), and its
spelling (or lexeme).

412fe -p <name> When a -p flag is present, 412fe should read the file specified by
<name>, scan it and parse it, build the intermediate representation, and report either success or
report all the errors that it finds in the input file.

412fe -r <name> When a -r flag is present, 412fe should read the file specified by <name>, scan
it, parse it, build the intermediate representation, and print out the information
